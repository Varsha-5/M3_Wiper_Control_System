# ABSTRACT

The Wiper speed control system is designed to make the vision clear to the drivers driving the car by wiping away the liquid drops sensed by a sensor in the
Windshield wipers are operated by an electric motor. The electric motor is attached to a worm gear, which transmits the necessary force to a long rod that sets the wiper arms in motion. The worm gear is able to generate the force required to move the wipers as fast as they need to move.This project is developed by having the STM32F407 Discover Board.
